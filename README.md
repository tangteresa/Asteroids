# Asteroids
**Language:** Java (developed in Eclipse) 

**Purpose:** Create an asteroids shooting game for AP Computer Science A

**Game description:** The player's ship flies through a field of asteroids attempting to reach planet X. Shooting asteroids with asteroids will destroy them, but bigger asteroids can take more damage before exploding! 

Coins must be collected along the way in order to buy powerups. Powerups can be collected and used temporarily, including health boost (gain a life), shield (automatically destroys asteroids in a certain radius), firework (spray lasers randomly), bomb (destroys all asteroids on screen), and coin magnet (collect coins within a certain radius of the ship). 

**How to play:**
Use right and left arrowkey to move right and left. Shoot with spacebar. Follow onscreen directions to buy powerups.
